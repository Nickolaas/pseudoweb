So saints have always made me curious, just because they are something you hear about but I don't know anything about. So i stumbled across these pages on wikipedia today:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saints_of_places">Patron Saints of Places</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saints_of_occupations_and_activities">Patron Saints of Stuff</a>

There are funny Patron Saints for all kinds of things, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Amand">boy scouts</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiacre">venereal disease</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zita">Housewives and Domestic servants and those who have lost items in their house.</a>

Anyway, just thought this was interesting and that i would put it out there that i have figured out one of my life goals, to become a Patron Saint of Technology and Trees.

Oh the joys that are the internet.
