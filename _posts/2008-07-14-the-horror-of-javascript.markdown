title: The Horror Of JavaScript

I used to find JavaScript scary. As a language it lets you do all kinds of cool things to the browser, but it also has a tendency to have very ugly code. Through my travels on the internet I came across all kinds of reports about how <acronym title="Cross Site Scripting">XSS</acronym> could steal everything you know without you ever knowing.

But these last few weeks have changed all of that. I decided to rebuild my <a title="Nat Welch .com" href="http://natwelch.com" target="_blank">personal site</a> (<a title="Prototype NatWelch.com" href="http://natwelch.com/index2.php" target="_blank">as seen here</a>) with javascript. Now it must be understood, I did not code this cool little accordion thingy. The credit for that goes entirely to <a href="http://www.dezinerfolio.com/2007/07/19/simple-javascript-accordions/" target="_blank">dezinerfolio.com</a>. I came across these guys through <a href="http://www.ajaxrain.com/" target="_blank">AjaxRain.com</a> and it worked well. The other thing it did was that the source code was included with the compacted code. Through looking at the source I learned that Javascript doesn't need to be incredibly scary, and with a little work it can even be readable.

Anyway, figured I would share.

p.s. Mongolian BBQ for lunch = YUM.

p.s.s. Fullscreen Editor that now comes with Wordpress rocks. Another reason why Javascript kicks butt.
