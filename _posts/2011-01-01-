Ah yes, 2010. You were a good year. You, like any year, had your ups and your downs, but at the very least you provided me with some good data.

In 2010, I started playing with foursquare. I didn't stick with it too long, but it created some interesting graphs.

Got really into ruby and into GitHub. Show top 5 projects I have worked on.

LastFM, show graphs, list my favorite albums of the year

iFixit, show graphs

tl;dr:

 * Wrote lots of code
 * Went to NYC and Washington, DC.
 * Next year I plan on graduating, moving to a city, and traveling Europe.
