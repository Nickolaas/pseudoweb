Hi Nat! We'd love to have this piece for Issue 3 of Code Words. 

The deadline for first drafts is Friday, May 15th, and the deadline for edits will be Friday, May 29th. 

We do edits on GitHub. When your first draft is ready, send it to me as a markdown file and I'll add it to the repo. I'll then introduce you to your technical editor and prose editor, and you'll all be able to work on the file together.

You'll be paid $200 on submission of the final piece on May 29th. I'll follow up soon with a contract (we are going to be licensing the work from you under the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license, and so you will retain all rights to your work indefinitely).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

All best,
Rachel

I would like to write an article summarizing good practices for scaling a website against a DDOS attack. Things you can do ahead of time that will make response easy, and how to load test your systems, all without spending insane amounts of money.
