This quarter I have been taking CSC484 at Cal Poly. CSC484 is a class offered
by the computer science department titled User Centered Interaction Design, and
is taught by Dr. Franz Kurfess.

This class changes every time it is taught, mainly due to the fact that
computer interaction is something that is constantly changing. New devices and
designs are being invented daily, which have the possibility to dramatically
change the space.

 - Talk about yahoo project
 - interesting problems dealing with processing
 - code I wrote, commented well.
