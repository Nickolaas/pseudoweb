A blog that I am currently loving is <a href="http://www.serifpublishing.com/" target="_blank">Serif</a>. Serif provides interesting designs that usually center around typography. Serif also talks about innovations in type and other news in the design world.

One neat thing that Serif does is hold these things called "revisions." Revisions allow for readers to send in their versions of current designs. The current revision, <a href="http://www.serifpublishing.com/?cat=48">revision 4</a>, ends today. Revision 4 asked readers to design covers for their favorite books. I am very sad that I stumbled across this so late, because I would have loved to make a cover for my favorite book, Neuromancer.

So head on over to Serif and <a href="http://www.serifpublishing.com/index.php?cat=48&amp;paged=5">check out some of the designs</a> people have submitted. They are all very good.

I even think that requiring students to declare a major upon entering college is ridiculous. The current mindset in parenting is to push kids into maturity at a younger age, and this in my mind is what is causing all of the problems we have in education, especially here in California.</li>
