After a year in London, I figured I'd write up the places I have eaten often and enjoyed. These are in no order and the organization is rough to say the least.

## Food

 * Dishoom - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Amazing Indian food. The wait is usually long, but worth it. I lad some sort of slow cooked lamb that was out of this world.

 * Busaba Eathai - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

A chain of Thai restaurants. Has a cool atmosphere and pretty good food.

 * Pham Sushi - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

This was the sushi place closest to my flat, so I ate here like once a week. They have two restaurants across the street from each other. One does take away and has some seats. The other is a fancy restaurant. The full restaurant was always packed, so I always went for the relaxed Take Away shop. Not amazing, but some of the better sushi for the price that I had in London.

 * Wagamama - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

A huge chain. I fell in love with the Ginger Chicken Udon. If I didn't want to think and was tired of wandering, Wagamama pretty much always has an empty seat and is pretty fast.

 * Bone Daddies - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

The best ramen I had in London. Place is small and always packed, but is open till midnight and serves food fast.

 * Dirty Burger - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

A greasy burger, but quite good.

 * Byron - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

A chain that's all over London. Courgette fries, one of their burgers (they were all solid), and the boiler room special (a pale ale and a shot of Makers Mark) was a good dinner if I was missing home.

 * Tozi - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Fantastic Italian small plates. Menu doesn't really change, but just bring a large group and order two of everything.

 * Cay Tre - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Really good Pho. They also have other Vietnamese dishes, but I only ever had the Pho. My favorite was the Garlic Hanoi Pho with Chinese dough and a beer on a rainy day. Packed at dinner time, but easy to find a seat for lunch.

 * The Breakfast Club - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

They serve breakfast all day. Popular brunch place.

 * Meat Mission - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Delicious burgers, but the wait is insane. Has a resident DJ spinning most nights, so it's pretty loud.

 * Homeslice - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

My favorite pizza in London. They do one size (20") with a delicious thin sourdough crust and a daily changing board of toppings.

 * Pizza East - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Good pizza in Shoreditch.

 * Whitecross Street Market - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Weekday lunch only, amazing food stalls. Changes often, and I've never had a bad meal. Cash only.

 * Borough Market  - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Open only a few days a week, but has delicious food to eat, plus a huge market. Gets really crowded, and a lot of places only take cash.

 * J + A Cafe - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Great brunch place when it's sunny out. Most of their seating is in a quiet alley way.

## Coffee


 * Fleet River Bakery - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Nice little bakery and coffee shop near Holborn station. Grab a delicious piece of banana bread and a Long Black and go for a walk in the park across the street, or through the London School of Economics and down Fleet Street.

 * Paper &amp; Cup - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Great coffee that goes to a good cause.

 * Montparnasse Cafe - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

I actually discovered this on my last day in London. Cute French bakery that has really good coffee, and killer breakfast baguettes.

 * Ozone - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Delicious coffee roaster, and also a good brunch place. If they have it, get the Duck hash or the duck confit eggs. Also, their v60 pour over is always good.

 * Lantana - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Solid brunch place that does a lot of good food, and decent coffee.

 * Department of Coffee and Social Affairs - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Love it for the name, kept comming back for the coffee and atmosphere.

 * Prufrock - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Claims to be the best espresso in London. Not sure if I agree, but it is really good. They also offer coffee brewing classes.

 * Foxcroft and Ginger - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Really hit or miss. Decent coffee and decent food, but I've had a few orders which were not up to par. Main selling point is it's next to Gosh! Comics, so you can buy a few trades and then get an eggs benedict and a pour over and lose a few hours.

 * Flat White - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

They have an amazing flat white, but not much seating.

 * Look mum no hands! - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Bike shop with good coffee and lots of seating.

 * Taylor St Baristas - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Decent caf√©.

 * Allpress Espresso - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

I could never get in to their actual store, but they have a great walk up cash only coffee bar outside around the corner.

 * Shoreditch Grind - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Over hyped, but if there isn't a line, make a decent croissant sandwich and an adequate latte.

 * Fix Coffee - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

They have a few shops. I really like their mochas. Usually have lots of seating.

 * Timberyard - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Has a few shops. I actually really liked their green tea and hummus sandwiches, but they also make a solid Latte.

## Beer

 * Sky Pod Bar - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

No real selection, but amazing views. Wait till they are giving free entry to the public and drink a beer while watching the sunset from atop the walkie talkie building.

 * Cask - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

"The Google SRE Bar" or the bar with lots of variety and deliciousness.

 * Brew Dog - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Lots of hoppy beers. Their Shoreditch location is usually packed. I would recommend Sheppard's Bush if you want to sit and enjoy your beer. Both sites have great selection though. I've never been to the Camden one.

 * Craft Beer Co. - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

There are a few of these, they are an extension of Cask, but usually even more packed because of the more desirable locations.

 * Any pub.

Seriously, just go into the nearest pub. It's probably pretty decent.

## Other

 * Columbia Road Flower Market - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Fresh flowers. Men yelling at you to buy their flowers. Quite the experience.

 * Gosh! Comics - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Two floors with a fantastic selection of comics, trades, graphic novels, indie publications and nice people.

 * Holland Park - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Gorgeous flowers, a Japanese Garden, a great youth hostel, lots of benches.

 * Hamstead Heath - [yelp]() &amp; [4sq]()

Great place to walk on a sunny day.

 * Primrose Hill

Great view of London
