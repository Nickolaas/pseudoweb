I just read an article detailing an email conversation between an NYU Professor
named [Scott Galloway][0] and an anonymous student. [The article][1] and it's
subsequent [hacker.news post][2] have lots of people arguing who here is in the
wrong, with many, if not most, siding with the student.

Seriously people?
