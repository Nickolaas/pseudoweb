So I've upgraded to Wordpress 2.5. Wow. Everything is so shiny!

One thing I've learned though is that the Internet grows far too fast for me. Just two years ago, things like auto saving posts and AJAX being used for more than just making warnings fade out were rare, if not non-existent. Now things have changed dramatically and it is changing every day.

So with that, I would like to inform the world that I will be starting writing on this site again. First I need to fix a few things, and those aren't getting fixed tonight.

So just sit back and relax, and listen to <a href="http://scw.ucsd.edu/schedule.php?s=4">Chris's radio show</a> while I go study for midterms some more.
