So I have mixed feeling about the big tragedy.When it hit, I was eating cereal watching the news with my mom. I took a Sony walkman to school that day so I could listen to what was happening and I spent all of my non-class time reading the time lines up on CNN.com. I had discussions, comforted my math teacher (she used to work there), and worried for my cousin Becky who worked almost across the street from the World Trade Center.

Now this all seems pretty normal in my mind. It was something many people were going through, it was a national disaster after all. But what bothered me, was that it didnt hurt me that much. I usually conclude that this is because I live in California and that in my mind the WTC is not that big of a symbol. But I guess something doesnt need to be a symbol until its involved right?

But, whatever it may be, I am glad that as a country we are sticking relatively together. Iunderstand differences, because opinion is one of the founding principles of our country, but I wish people would just learn to see where the other is coming from. Yay for compromise!

Anyway, heres to the bad, the good, the new, and the old. Cheers!

Hasta.
