<h2>You are most like Matt Mullenweg!</h2>
You are most like <a href="http://www.photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a>. Though you recognize your authority, you do not relish the idea of using your power too aggressively. Instead, you rely on peers a lot. You do participate in the social media world, but it is not something that occupies a lot of time. You most likely devote yourself to projects that you feel passionate about and tend to evangelize those things quite a bit.
