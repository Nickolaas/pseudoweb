I think I am very weird. You see, everyone is really excited that it is October and everyone knows what October means right? Halloween. I, unlike many, am not a big fan of Halloween. Some say that I am just a poor sport, but I really do not enjoy dressing up. Sure I love the benefits like large parties and loads of candy, but I never really enjoyed the day.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Once again, Maybe it is just that I am crazy, but dressing up has never been a big thing with me. I never cared if it was cool or not, which is what I am often accused of. It's more of, like I said, the fact that I find no joy in changing my appearance.</p>
Why this is I have no idea. I mean I have always had very happy Halloweens, and I usually spend them with friends as we romp through the streets looking for candy and other sources of amusement. Now, I hope that some realize that by age 18, you are a little too old to be trick-or-treating. We went last year, which was fun, but the weird looks the girls in my group got were a bit ridiculous. Sure we got candy, but to these people we all looked like teenagers who couldn't escape the fact that they weren't ten anymore.

Mind you, this is starting to sound like the old, too cool/mature for doing this sorta thing, but even if I was still twelve, I don't see the big draw to Halloween.

Anyway, I have had this discussion with many before, and I usually come out looking like the bad guy, because it sounds like I am bashing many peoples favorite holiday, but in reality, I just can't see what is so great about the day.
