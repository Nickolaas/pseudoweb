<blockquote>This citys killing me...  Sugarcult</blockquote>
So I love a lot of things in life. Today though, had a few of my favorite things, overcast weather, beautiful trees, kind people, and good music. I believe that with these things I can be happy in life, and I know it sounds silly, but here are my reasons why.

<strong>Overcast Weather</strong>
Lets be honest, the sun is great. It helps everything grow, provides warmth and provides warmth. But nice overcast weather makes me feel so great. Its filtered sunlight provides soft shadows and makes everything far more vibrant than in the sun. It is far less warm, and I dont get sun burnt. And things still grow because the clouds dont full cover the sun.

<strong>Beautiful Trees</strong>
Trees are great. I love how there are so many different varieties. I especially like Tall ones with big overhangs to provide speckled shadows and homes for squirrels. The fresh air that comes from trees is great to inhale. I dont know what else, but everything is better with trees.

<strong>Kind People</strong>
Good people are awesome. They just make every day so much more enjoyable. For instance today I met this guy Alaska, he was just awesome to talk to, and our plan to herd deer was even better. People like Alaska, Maggie, Dave, Chris, Kristen, and everyone else all make each day fun to be alive. All in all, I like kind people because there are very few things that are better alone.

<strong>Good Music</strong>
Tunes to walk to, tunes to drive to, and music to live to. As I roll through life I want to have music playing. I enjoy just about anything, so as long as it has some quality in it, it will add a little bounce to my step.

All of this came together this week. I kept running into various combinations of the four above things. I wrote an essay for my English teacher in sophomore year that talked about these very things. You see, anyone can see the bigger picture if they just open their eyes and look around. But if you want to find happiness in the little things in life, you really need to give the big picture the finger and just focus on everything as a separate entity. But be careful, you have a high chance of walking into a poll if you dont go back to the big picture every once in awhile.

Hasta.
