2011 was a tumultuous year for Nathaniel Welch. [In 2010](/2010/12/30/2010-year-in-review/), I said that in 2011 I would graduate from college, travel Europe and move to a city. Seems like a lot for a year, right? Well I agree. On top of those three things, I also quit my job at [iFixit][], started working at [Punchd][], which then got [acquired][] by [Google][]. Insanity.
