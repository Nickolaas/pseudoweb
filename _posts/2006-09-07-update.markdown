Hello fellow warriors, sorcerers, and rangers. Hows life? Is the internet treating you well? For me, we are getting along better, but not great. My web host,<a href="http://8-95.com"> 8-95.com</a>, crashed for the first time in years, which was annoying. Losing all of my databaseswas slightly more annoying.

Posts are going to be scattered for a little while, I am going to go through and see what is broken and what not. 

I am in Santa Rosa also visiting some good friends and as they say Nating it up. So this weekend expect everything to clean up and stuff to get rolling again. I was able to recover one post from Googles cache, but I dont think Ill be bringing the rest back, because my backup hadnt happened yet (it was scheduled for Friday).  But if I get time Ill go back through. Anyway, sorry for the slow down and I hope to type this weekend. 

Peace.
