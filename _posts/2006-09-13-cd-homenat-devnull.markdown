Don't you just hate those days where you want to do nothing? This is the first time in awhile that I have felt this way. It is actually really annoying.I should either be A) packing for college, or B) Doing Something. But in the end what do I do? Absolutely nothing. Well maybe one of these days I will develop will power or something. Until then maybe I can try to get something done, maybe a walk or something outdoors, who knows.
