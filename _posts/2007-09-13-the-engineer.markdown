I do love me some video games. One of the things I am particularly excited about is Valve's upcoming Orange Box. The Orange Box looks to be one of the best deals in gaming, plus just amazing, all in a box, that is a sexy shade of orange.

<a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/index.php">Gametrailers.com</a> has provided many a enjoyable trailer for the gamers delight, and Valve has released many <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/85205.html">trailers for the upcoming Orange Box</a>, including the game I am most anticipating, <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/11883.html">Portals</a>.

And while I am looking forward to Portals a lot, I am enjoying the trailers that Valve has been releasing for Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress was always a lot of fun when I was younger. I love playing the engineer, mainly because of the fact that you could build these gigantic turrets. Well Valve has finally <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/24780.html">released the Engineer movie</a>, and it is hilarious. So if you have time, go watch the Engineer movie, and go <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/">read up on the Orange box</a>, which will be amazing.

Enjoy,
