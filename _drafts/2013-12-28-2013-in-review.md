Ladies and Gentlemen, it is time again for Nathaniel "Nat" Welch's year in review. Compared to [2012](/2013/01/05/2012-year-in-review/), 2013 was a little quieter, with a big change at the end.

## January

January was a pretty simple month. I continued working at Google and continued dating Annie.

My friends Dave, Le, Richard and I went and hung out in Lake Almanor for a few days.

## August

In the beginning of August, Google had a big SRE get-together in Mountain View. Because of this, the San Francisco part of our team finally got a group picture together. I also attended [Outside Lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_Lands_Music_and_Arts_Festival) for the third time and had a blast. It was especially awesome because my buddy John Bernard came down from Seattle to attend as well.

At the end of August, Travis and I went up to Seattle for [PAX](http://prime.paxsite.com/). We played video games for three days, explored [UW](https://www.washington.edu/) for a day and hung out with our cousins and some of my friends.

## September

I stayed up in Seattle for an extra week for work after Travis and I visited PAX, and then visited Annie's cousins and her parents on [Bainbridge Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bainbridge_Island,_Washington).

I also went to a wonderful wedding with Annie for her two friends Matt and Kelly. This caused the unthinkable: I actually bought and wore a suit for the first time in my life.

## October

October was probably the craziest month in a long time. My team in San Francisco was shut down, and we were given the option to move to London or Seattle if we wanted to keep working on the same project. I spent most of the month consulting friends and coworkers trying to figure out what to do.

I also got to meet [Alexis Ohanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian) and watch one of Travis' last marching band shows at his high school.

## November

I decided to [move to London](http://pseudoweb.net/2013/11/06/moving-to-london/), and sadly broke up with Annie.

## December

In December, I visited London, preparing for my move. My original plan being that I would explore the city, but instead I spent the whole time in meetings... #facepalm. Oh well. I also visited one of my favorite people Chris, with our good friend Dave up in Portland, and spend two weeks up in the mountains with my family.
