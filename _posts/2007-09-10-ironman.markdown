So excited, and I just can't hide it.

The Merchant of Death. Awesome.  Check out <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/ironman/">the trailer page</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)">Ironman wikipedia page</a>. So a few comments on this film trailer. First, I think the Robert Downey Jr. was a great choice for the role, at least it seems so in this trailer. I'm hoping that he can play the cocky bastard / genius / superhero role well. It looks like he definitely has Stark's pre-Ironman image down pat. On top of this, it seems like the suit does a great job looking like the Iroman costume from the modern comic books, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_%28comic_book%29">Civil War</a>.Finally I am happy that the movie is located all in California, even though the comic is based in New York. Why? Because California doesn't get enough love from Marvel :p
Hasta,
