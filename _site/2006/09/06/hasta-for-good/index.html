<p>So interesting weekend, first off I was going to post something Thursday night, but I found out my web server was down. Same thing happened Friday night and Saturday morning, and then again today (today being Sunday) you see I am up in the mountains, and posting to you guys is hard, heck finding an internet connection is hard, but if you see this, then all is well.
<!--more-->
But I figure that I will share my pain with you. Nothing brings readers and bloggers together like internet horror stories, so take a seat (if youre not sitting already that is) and get ready for a fun little story.</p>

<p>So background first. I started on the internet a long time ago, back when I was five. I explored the vasttraces of the World Wide Web when my dad installed Windows 95, a big upgrade from the Windows 3.1 I had been using;it had games and stuff which was a blast. Anyway I ventured around and a few years later I became one of the first users of Geocities.com</p>

<p>Now geocities didnt use to be owned by Yahoo, but it was an amazing website. I built my own website with my moms help and I was off. Fast-forward eight years and I was taking a web-design class in high school. I proposed to my mom the idea of her owning a website, she was all heck yesand I was all Wahoo! Anyway I built her a website for my final that year and also built my own http://icco.lydiadehn.com, which has since become decommissioned.</p>

<p>The web host I chose was 8-95.com which had a wonderful deal, $3.95 a month for a full featured website. Since then our account has grown and now with over triple the original specs we only pay $7.95 a month. My moms website slowly fell into disarray but two years ago I bought pseudoweb.net and have been using it since. Since starting with 8-95.com I have had one period of downtime, five hours on a Sunday evening. But it was back when I woke up so I cant complain.</p>

<p>Thursday started the longest period of downtime since I joined this web host and I am a little worried because it is possible they cant access our backups (that server got corrupted too supposedly). Anyway, I hope it all turns out fine and this doesnt become the first post.</p>

<p>Also for those wondering, I upgraded my computer recently and accidentally deleted the records of what my previous styles looked like, but at version 3.5 and version 6 I reformatted my site and started from scratch. 3.5 was when I got Wordpress and pseudoweb.net, 6.0 was when I started college.</p>

<p>Hasta, for now.</p>

<p>p.s. It came back up on tuesday with nothing. Rebuilding as i can.</p>
