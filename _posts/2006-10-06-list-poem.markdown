If I were to make a list, it would be an amazing list. Not a list of my favorite animals or what kinds of food I liked. Not a silly list, nor a profound list, but an amazing list.

This amazing list would knock me on my feet when I finished writing it.

Take a minute, analyze that line.

Realize that I said “knock on” not knock off. I want to be on my feet and moving around, I want this list, this amazing list, to inspire me to do what I want to do. I would check the list at a predetermined interval and each time I would say, Something, and then keep moving forward.

The amazing list that I would write would be about my goals. My goals today, my goals tomorrow, and my goals in life. None of them would say why, or how, or even when, just what. Because in my head I can figure out how, and when, and where, and why.

I just need What.
