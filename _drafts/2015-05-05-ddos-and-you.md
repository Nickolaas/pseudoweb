## What is a DDOS?

A DDOS is a Distributed [Denial of Service Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). They are happening all the time on the internet, wars being played out by computers trying to make other computers inaccasible or overloaded.

The [Digital Attack Map](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/) gives you an idea of what's going on. It is an interesting display of different types of attacks happening across the internet at any one time.

Not all of these are nessisarily malicious attacks. Some users may remember the term "[Slashdotted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect)", which was where a website was featured on [/.](http://slashdot.org/) and the traffic directed to their site took them offline. We still see this time to time when sites unexpectedly get featured on sites like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
