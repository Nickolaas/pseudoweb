What is up Home Fry?

Ok, I'll admit that I stole that line and I'm not quoting it.

Fine I can't hold out anymore. The line is from <a href="http://accidenthash.podshow.com/">Accident Hash</a>, one of my favorite PodCasts.

Anyway, lets get back to the point of the post. I came across three great articles today. One is about Wikipedia, one is about showers, and one is about self expression. So lets get started.

Ok, <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, is one of the greatest things on the internet. It helps spread what I think is the most important thing in the world, Information. Without information we would all be clueless. Plus, information promotes individuality and all kinds of stuff I love, but I will hold the information is better than money speech for another day.

<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Raw Thought</a> has an article out describing <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia">who writes Wikipedia</a>. An interesting read that brings to light some interesting things. First of all, 0.07% of Wikipedia users make 50% of the edits. This is a scary fact and made me wonder. How can so few people hold, create, and publish so much raw information? Well the author went on to research this information and found that it isnt as scary. You see while very few people do all of the editing, many more users create the original information which makes me happy. Wikipedia is the knowledge of the universe put into a book. Can anyone say Hitchhikers Guide to The Universe?
<blockquote>I come up with a lot of ideas and remember things to do while I'm in the shower. However, by the time I get out of said shower, I've forgotten 3/4 of what I'd come up with.</blockquote>
This is so true. I wish I could fix this. <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/">Pinkerton</a> <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/pinkerton/archives/016928.html">is trying to solve this problem.</a>

<a href="http://coloradostartups.com/">Colorado Startups</a> informed me that <a href="http://coloradostartups.com/?p=97">to be someone you must exist on the web</a>. My roommate does not exist on the web. He must not exist. Who said Colorado knew anything?

Be Safe. Have a somber Monday.
