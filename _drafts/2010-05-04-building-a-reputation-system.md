In November 2009, iFixit released [Answers][2]. When we started on this
project, we thought long and hard about how integral of a part we wanted
Answers to be in relation to the rest of the site. We already had a forum
system that we had coded based on our comment system throughout our teardowns
and guides.

One of the big parts of this system is the ability to gain reputation.
