Another quick update, also conveniently Starcraft based. Back when i was active on battle.net, there were these awesome maps called Tower Defense. You built a maze trying to keep the constant wave of baddies from going to the other side of the map. Well, I was pointed to the this fantastic flash game called <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/" title="DTD">Desktop Tower Defense</a>.

Same concept as the Starcraft maps, you build a maze with different types of towers that try to kill off all of the bad guys before they reach the end.Â  To understand how popular this game is, check out it's <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/News.asp">news page,</a> the stats are showing at least 2000 individual players each hour, plus over 5 billion bad guys destroyed each hour.

See what <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Desktop+Tower+Defense" title="Technorati DTD">others in the blogosphere are saying</a>, and also check <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/008758.html">this hilarious post </a>on why you shouldn't play this game.

Cya later,
