2011 was a tumultuous year for Nathaniel Welch. [In 2010](/2010/12/30/2010-year-in-review/), I said that in 2011 I would graduate from college, travel Europe and move to a city. Seems like a lot for a year, right? Well I agree. On top of those three things, I also quit my job at [iFixit][], started working at [Punchd][], which then got [acquired][] by [Google][]. Insanity.

Some of this insanity is visible in Last.fm's graph of my year's listening trends.

We can see I listened to more music during winter quarter when I was applying to jobs and also trying make sure I graduated on time. Around May and June, my listening started to calm down. I was pretty sure I was in the clear, but still freaking out a little. Then, on June 11th, 2011, I graduated!

Then, you'll notice a giant dip in listening. All of July, I was [in Europe](/2011/07/05/summer-2011-postcard-1/) (I didn't write nearly enough about my trip...) and June was spent moving and visiting people.

In August, I moved to the [Parkside District][] in San Francisco and started working at Google!
