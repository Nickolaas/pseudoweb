I recently took a vacation to New York City to visit an old friend. The trip was
a blast and ended up being some of the most fun I've had in a long while.

I arrived Thursday morning, around 7am, at JFK. I took the A train into
Manhattan, and met my friend Aaron at the FIT Dorms by Penn Station. We had a
quick breakfast, but then he headed into work and I started to walk up 8th
Avenue.

I passed the New York Times Building, which is just gorgeous. I continued to
walk North, and found Columbus Circle and Central Park. Instead of walking up
Central Park West, I went up Broadway, but quickly realized my mistake. I tried
cutting across the park on 65th street, and let me tell you, that road is not
built for people.

I found the Met, but it had a pretty long line, so I decided to wander around
the Upper East Side. I fell asleep in a Starbucks, and enjoyed Pizza at this
delicious place called Roma's.

I then walked back to the Met, and spent three awesome hours wandering around
inside.

I really loved the wide variety of stuff inside the Met, and the Picasso
exhibit was awesome (although it really showed his decent into insanity...).
