Welcome to the "new" pseudoweb.net! In reality, we aren't that new, but we are now on a brand new server provided by <a href="http://www.dixiesys.com/">Dixiesys Hosting</a> and a new theme from Phu Ly.

The other thing new about the site is my little <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> status up top. It is powered by the wordpress <a href="http://www.deanjrobinson.com/wordpress/twitt-twoo">Twitt-Too plugin</a>. I also use the Firefox plugin <a href="http://spatialviews.com/twitterbar/">Twitterbar</a> to update my twitter, it's rather convenient. Anyway, much more depressing article latter, I promise...

p.s. <a href="http://twitter.com/icco">Add me in Twitter</a> :)
