... a friend just sent me this. So excited.

...hmm... Wordpress and embedded youtube are not working together. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSqVRUlvOjA">Here is the link, you should watch it</a>.

Also, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmZRDUO1wGQ">this Fedex commercial</a> makes me laugh

Anyways, I loved Heroes last season, it was the only TV show I actually watched. And seeing as how I tend not to watch TV, that's saying something.
