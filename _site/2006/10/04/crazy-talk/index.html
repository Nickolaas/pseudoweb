      <p>I think I am very weird. You see, everyone is really excited that it is October and everyone knows what October means right? Halloween. I, unlike many, am not a big fan of Halloween. Some say that I am just a poor sport, but I really do not enjoy dressing up. Sure I love the benefits like large parties and loads of candy, but I never really enjoyed the day.</p>

<p><!--more--></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Once again, Maybe it is just that I am crazy, but dressing up has never been a big thing with me. I never cared if it was cool or not, which is what I am often accused of. It's more of, like I said, the fact that I find no joy in changing my appearance.</p>


<p>Why this is I have no idea. I mean I have always had very happy Halloweens, and I usually spend them with friends as we romp through the streets looking for candy and other sources of amusement. Now, I hope that some realize that by age 18, you are a little too old to be trick-or-treating. We went last year, which was fun, but the weird looks the girls in my group got were a bit ridiculous. Sure we got candy, but to these people we all looked like teenagers who couldn't escape the fact that they weren't ten anymore.</p>

<p>Mind you, this is starting to sound like the old, too cool/mature for doing this sorta thing, but even if I was still twelve, I don't see the big draw to Halloween.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have had this discussion with many before, and I usually come out looking like the bad guy, because it sounds like I am bashing many peoples favorite holiday, but in reality, I just can't see what is so great about the day.</p>

<p>/Rant <br/>
