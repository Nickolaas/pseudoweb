So this is pretty awesome, <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/788/788627p1.html" title="IGN's coverage of Starcraft2">IGN</a>, and the <a href="http://www.starcraft2.com/" title="StarCraft2 DAWT COM!">general internet</a>, has shown me the light. On May 19th Blizzard announced Starcraft 2. I suggest you go check out the above sites, just because they give great pictures of both gameplay and concept art.

Most of the units have been retooled and things look cleaner and it sounds as though choices were made to make the three races better. The issue that i am noticing is that right now the game seems to have the same interface. The game basically looks the same.  I am really hoping that they make some significant changes because right now, i dont see why people would want to spend the money. I understand that the game is not yet finalized, but seriously, would you pay $50 for  a retooled version of an old game?

Well I'm hopeful. Blizzard has done a lot right with their Warcraft series, now if we are lucky they might make up for Starcraft: Ghost.
