[Alright, alright, alright](http://youtu.be/X4bg4Q63kJQ). Another year done, lets walk through the year in photos and other things. If you're curious about my past posts, you can see [2013](http://pseudoweb.net/2013/12/28/2013-in-review/), [2012](http://pseudoweb.net/2013/01/05/2012-year-in-review/), [2011](http://pseudoweb.net/2011/12/26/2011-year-in-review/) and [2010](http://pseudoweb.net/2010/12/30/2010-year-in-review/).

I took way more photos than usual this year, which you can see in order [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/sets/72157639471288384/). I've sampled some of my favorite and/or most representative of each month.

## January:

January was chaos. I sold, gave away or packaged everything I owned. Including my prized Jeep. Held a few get togethers with friends and family.

Then I did a two week trip to Seattle for work. And then on the 30th, flew to London with a ton of suitcases.

## February:

During the second month of the year, I wandered around London a lot and started working at Google London. I basically felt Jetlagged for a month. Completely out of place.

I luckily had two friends visit around my birthday, [C.H.](https://twitter.com/calbach) and [Alex Baldwin](http://alexbaldwin.com/). We wandered London together, and then spent a weekend in Milan, which was awesome.

## The whole year...

I listened to a lot of music (Generated by [Last.FM Playground](http://playground.last.fm/demo/listeningtrends)):

[![Nat's 2014 in music](/images/2014/12/lastfm2014.png)](/images/2014/12/lastfm2014.pdf)

And wrote a lot of code:
