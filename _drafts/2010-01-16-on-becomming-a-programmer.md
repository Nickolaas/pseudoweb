 > A long time ago, in a very distant land, I studied under a grey bearded master where he taught me the secrets of the ancient art of programming. We stood on our hands and programmed Fortran with our eyes closed. We programmed web servers with just a six switch in board to a PDP-10. 

Programming is viewed as almost a mystic art. Often people, such as myself, view it as an act so secretive, that it is hard to pick up with out years of training.
