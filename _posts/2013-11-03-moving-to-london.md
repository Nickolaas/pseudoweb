Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends and Foes, Nathaniel Welch is moving to London, England.

This might be coming out of the blue to some of you, so let me give a little backstory. In early October, the team I work on at Google decided to reorganize due to a variety of reasons. We decided to go from having teams in Seattle, San Francisco and Banglore to having teams in Seattle and London. Those of us in San Francisco were offered the opportunity to move to Seattle or London.

I thought long and hard, and petitioned many of you for your oppinions. I made a post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/natwelch/posts/10201266199151373), which pretty much unaminmously said I should go live abroad. I think I actually only got one negative response from my brother, and knowing his sense of humor, he was basically agreeing with the populous.
