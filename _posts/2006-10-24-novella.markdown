Just got this in an email, and it reminded me of something i am really looking forward to:

<blockquote>Its almost upon us, that magical time of year when anything seems possible, when the daily cares of life fade away and we focus on something so much bigger than ourselves (no, not the Holidays). Seven days from now another NaNo will commence</blockquote>

Yes that is correct, <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NanoWriMo</a> is comming! You should <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/register.php">register! </a> and you could even look at <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=115575">my profile</a>.

Anyway NanoWriMo is really exciting me this year because of what i did last year. What i did last year was get very little done while participating, and now it is a new year and time for more dedication and maybe even successfulness! (that is so not a word...)

Anyway i have convinced a few people to join me and i am joinging a few others, so thankfully i am not alone. 

Heres to a novel in one month!

Hasta.
