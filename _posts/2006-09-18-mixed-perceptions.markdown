Well I am now in college. Mixed feelings all-around, especially the sun burn I got today. The sun is so lame its not even funny. Anyway I am pretty happy, especially as the oddness and what not of meeting new people in large groups. I mean I dont have a problem with meeting new people but approaching a large group of people is sorta awkward.

Anyway, today was lame until tonight where we played a 6 on 7 game of Nerf basketball in our lounge. Awesome. My team won which made it even better, but it was just fun to get to know new people, we even had girls from the floor above us come down and play.

But anyway I feel like a totally uninformed idiot. On Saturday I thought I was in a coed floor because a room or two was full of women, simple assumption right? No. One of my floor mates has four sisters, Doh.

So, ya Im happy, WOW is tomorrow which should be cool.
