Hey there kiddos,

I've been thinking lately that I should talk about my firefox setup, so I guess I'll put that right here.

## Theme

 * [Whitehart](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/364)

     A Very nice lightweight theme. Looks great on every OS except OS X. On OS
     X I just use the default. 

## Extensions

 * Firebug
 * Web Developer
 * Screengrab!
 * Download Toolbar
 * Weave
 * Ad Block Plus
