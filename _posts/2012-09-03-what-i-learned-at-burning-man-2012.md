I spent the last week at Burning Man, in the wonderful [Black Rock City, Nevada][brc-map].

Things I learned:

 * People are crazy
 * Given enough passion, duct tape and freedom, people create some pretty crazy shit

 Put some photos here.

I am slightly worried that I am going to die.

 > On the Tuesday following Burning Man 2002, a thousand or so poor souls experienced "Alpha", which started with no warning at midday and lasted for almost three days, with sustained winds at 70mph gusting to over 100mph. DPW did their best, they locked down Burning Man (you couldn't see to find your way out anyway). People were injured (although none seriously) and everyone was left shaken and reminded why it says on the ticket "By Attending This Event You risk Serious Injury or Death". Greeters told us "we dodged a bullet, this could have caused great injury and even fatalities". We helped our friends (11 year veterans) in desperate need and I left with a determination to tell the story of Alpha/2002. You can see our Alpha/2002 page with photos here.
