As far as I know, everyone has someone they aspire to be. They have some sort of answer to the question "what do you want to be when you grow up?" Sometimes it's "I want to be the president" or "I want to be like Angelina Jolie". This is something that gets more complex as time progresses, but if you simplify the questions you're asking yourself, I think it usually comes down to some sort of goal, a shadow on the cave wall that you reach towards.

When I was in highschool, [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/about/) was my hero. He was a few years older than me, and had done something truly impressive. He took an existing open source blogging platform, forked it, and built a community around it. By the time I excited highschool he had even turned that opensource software into a company. At the time (and this is still true), I believed there was nothing more noble than building a culture around a tool that promoted the freedom of expression and the sharing of information.

Now that I've grown older, I often have much larger and varied problems (although probably all variations on the concept of intial question). I've found that the best way for me to work through my decisions is to run them past a variety of friends, and then use their advice and world views to help me make a decision.

## Niket + Reed

[Niket Desai](http://niket.com/) and [Reed Morse](http://reedmorse.com/) are basically the perfect combination of fine dining and trouble. If you have an idea, a problem, an interesting thing you saw, these two will give you a few things. First, if you've got a problem, the solution is always the most interesting and baller thing possible. Wanna get married? Buy out a hotel in Hawaii. Wanna party, get a luxery suite in Vegas or Reno and ten of your best buds. If you've got an idea or thing, these two will riff with you on the millions of existing products that touch on the space already and provide interesting insights into the future of the space.

The two together are probably the perfect combo because of who they are. Niket is a genius kid who never stops. He's got his hands in forty projects, always exploring, always learning, always trying new things. When we were at 500 startups, he was infamous for skateboarding up to other groups, dropping a ten second piece of wisdom on your project and then skate away. He's got an infatuation with NASA, probably because it's the one space he hasn't been able to physically explore.

Reed is a next-gen hacker. He has his pulse on what the trend-setters on the internet are just starting to play with. He was building Android apps before Android was cool. He had prototyped wearables before wearables were a thing. Hell, he built more startups than most before he graduated highschool. He's a fountain of cool ideas and interesting takes on the space.

## Alex Baldwin + Kayvon

Artist Hacker Hipster Futurists? Kayvon and Baldwin are interesting dudes. They are usually the two most chasing the beautiful life hacks.

## Mark Gius + David Horn

Lets say these two gentlemen are the largest Nerds I know. Dave led and a few others and myself on a very long D&amp;D campaign, oh, and I met him on Twitter, back when there were like forty people on Twitter. I met Mark Gius (or as my brother likes to call him Juicy Gius) in college. we ended up living together for three years and became one of my best friends due to our shared love of video games and sandwiches.

When I think about a problem like these two, I believe there are two questions that tend to come out:

 1. What is the theme of the story here?
 2. Is it perfect?
