As far as I know, everyone has someone they aspire to be, if not that, they have some sort of answer to the question "what do you want to be when you grow up?" Sometimes the answer is "I want to be the president" or "I want to be like Angelina Jolie". As time progresses, and I grow older, I have found that these answers tend to get more complex. My theory is if you simplify the questions you are asking yourself, it usually comes down to some sort of goal, a shadow on the cave wall that you reach towards.

When I was in high school, [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt/about/) was my hero. He was a few years older than me, and had done something truly impressive. He took an existing open source blogging platform, [forked it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2/cafelog#History), and built a community around it. By the time I excited high school he had even turned that open source software into [a company](http://automattic.com/). At the time (and this is still true), I believed there was nothing more noble than building a culture around a tool that promoted the freedom of expression and the sharing of information.

Now that I've grown older, I often have much larger and varied problems (although probably all variations on the concept of initial question). Many on the internet suggest that you should find a mentor, or someone older who can help you move forward. I don't explicitly have a mentor (and who knows maybe I'll find one some day), but I have found that the best way for me to work through my decisions and problems is to run them past a variety of friends.

The funny thing about this is I have now built mental models of the types of answers some of my friends will provide. These models are shallow shadow copies of the individuals and will never replace their actual advice, but on short notice, these models work as a nice approximation. I've decided to try and turn these models into text, hopefully in a way that causes you to think about how those around you affect your decision making process, and in a way that won't insult those mentioned...

## Niket + Reed

[Niket Desai](http://niket.com/) and [Reed Morse](http://reedmorse.com/) are basically the perfect combination of fine dining and trouble. If you have an idea, a problem, an interesting thing you saw, these two will give you a few things. First, if you've got a problem, the solution is always the most interesting and baller thing possible. Wanna get married? Buy out a hotel in Hawaii. Wanna party, get a luxury suite in Vegas or Reno and ten of your best buds. If you've got an idea or thing, these two will riff with you on the millions of existing products that touch on the space already and provide interesting insights into the future of the space.

The two together are probably the perfect combo because of who they are. Niket is a genius kid who never stops. He's got his hands in forty projects, always exploring, always learning, always trying new things. When we were at 500 startups, he was infamous for skateboarding up to other groups, dropping a ten second piece of wisdom on your project and then skate away. He's got an infatuation with NASA, probably because it's the one space he hasn't been able to physically explore.

Reed is a next-gen hacker. He has his pulse on what the trend-setters on the internet are just starting to play with. He was building Android applications before Android was cool. He had prototyped wearables before wearables were a thing. Hell, he built more startups than most before he graduated high school. He's a fountain of cool ideas and interesting takes on the space.

Artist Hacker Hipster Futurists? Kayvon and Baldwin are interesting dudes. They are usually the two most chasing the beautiful life hacks.

## Mark Gius + David Horn

Lets say these two gentlemen are the largest Nerds I know. Dave led and a few others and myself on a very long D&amp;D campaign, oh, and I met him on Twitter, back when there were like forty people on Twitter. I met Mark Gius (or as my brother likes to call him Juicy Gius) in college. We ended up living together for three years and became one of my best friends due to our shared love of video games and sandwiches.

When I think about a problem like these two, I believe there are two questions that tend to come out:

 1. What is the theme of the story here?
 2. Is it perfect?
