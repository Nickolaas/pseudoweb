Hello everyone!

I'm writing this to you as I head north from London to Edinburgh via the East Coast Train. It is pretty gray outside, but I've been enjoying the ride.

Anyways, this last week I have been in London, England. It has been a blast and I'm throughly sore from the trip.

You can see [my photos from the whole trip over on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/icco/sets/72157626961341287/).
