__IN PROGRESS__

Cal Poly has been an interesting place for the last four and a half years. The school's motto is "Learn By Doing", and I have found no reason to disagree. Poly has taught me to create new things and try everything. Today, Marissa Mayer, came to talk about how "Innovation at the Googleplex", and I think it will be interesting to compare her views of corporate innovation versus the innovation and real-life experience that is promoted here at Cal Poly.

The talk started with a nice introduction by Dr. Ignatios Vakalis discussing the history of the Internet and computing.

Didn't start doing user studies until around 18 months in.

First users waited a few minutes because the page was too simple, added copyright line to make users understand page had finished loading.

Where are the servers? In 1999 they were renting space and trying to figure a better way to fit computers in the space.

Talked about system pipeline. Takes about half a second and hits multiple data-centers.

Ran a eight year split AB test by accident. Analysed data, users searched more who saw ads.

20% time promoted new ideas and interested employees.

Let people be creative and develop their own spaces. Promote thinking different.

How to give everyone more mail storage? Storage is cheap. We have the infrastructure.

How do we revolutionise mapping?

 * street view

Let's build a browser that works better with web applications. If people use the web more, they search more.

Google moderator. Democracy on the web.

Where are the next big breakthroughs?

 * Google translate : automated machine translation. 
 * Speech recognition 
   * can be used with translate
   * 20% searches from Android phones are voice
 * Visual recognition
   * Google goggles
 * Contextual discovery


When dealing with data versus design, how do you choose? How do you choose what the users like versus the business.
 * 41 shades. People click more with red versus green tints of blue

Google's opinion of net neutrality

 * "How can you be against neutrality?" -MM
 * "More content gets accessed when there is a level playing field." - MM

Has having shareholders changed your innovation? Founders wrote a very explicit letter explaining what they wanted when they went public. Google has tried, and now has multiple multi-billion dollar revenue streams.

Choosing the difference between taking $20 a year for search versus advertising.

We view our users as customers, even though they don't pay.

The reason we care about SEO is because it "can hurt the user experience."

"Every aquisition is ultimately different."

"Work on hard problems. Work on stuff that matters to people."
