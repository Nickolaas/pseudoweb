Ok so for a Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>, today rocked. I am starting to like the college scene a little more and I am slowly understanding how this whole thing works. I am starting to learn more time management, sadly through trial and error.

So anyway this morning calculus was cancelled, and then I got my computer working again. Two leaps for joy.

I just am finishing up at a forty person LAN party, which basically destroyed me, and have a meeting tomorrow at noon. I am so screwed.

Anyway Ill post later, and this theme will change sometime next week once I get my Adobe products back.
